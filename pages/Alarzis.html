<p class = "paragraph summary">There's things in what you've said that we do not want to retain about alarzis ore and alarzium. We'll keep in mind the following things :</p>
<ul>
<li>Alarzis ore is an imaginary rare ore found quite deep underground. It is also found in larger quantities in geodes, but these are even more rare.</li>
<li>In its raw form, alarzis ore is a very dark blue crystal, opaque, without having any type of emissions (neither light nor radiation for example). Alarzis ore is also called alarzite when pure.</li>
<li>Alarzis ore is very resistant to scratching and to a point pressure, but relatively breakable when subjected to high pressure over time.</li>
<li>Alarzite is not dense. The largest ones are quite often hollow. Generally speaking, the structure of alarzite is very lightweight.</li>
<li>Chemical compounds and mineral content of alarzis remain unknown. We can only conjecture the presence of carbon in small quantities.</li>
<li>Alarzite have distinct cleavage planes. When breaking alarzis, which requires high pressure over a long period of time, it fractures in thick planes that follow the overall form of the crystal.</li>
<li>Refining alarzis requires an also rare fungus called Mycorise, that can only be grown in dark places, with specific conditions such as temperature and moisture.</li>
<li>Refining process require alarzis to be purified in alarzite. After that, alarzite must be stored for a long period in a place filled with mycorises so that an unknown chemical coumpound from the fungus can interact with the alarzite.</li>
<li>The alarzite, after that interaction, must be melt into a whole new metal, the alarzium.</li>
</ul>
<p class = "paragraph summary">My question is : what could be the properties of alarzium if you have to imagine them ?</p>
