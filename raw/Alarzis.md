# Alarzis

There's things in what you've said that we do not want to retain about alarzis ore and alarzium. We'll keep in mind the following things :

* Alarzis ore is an imaginary rare ore found quite deep underground. It is also found in larger quantities in geodes, but these are even more rare.
* In its raw form, alarzis ore is a very dark blue crystal, opaque, without having any type of emissions (neither light nor radiation for example). Alarzis ore is also called alarzite when pure.
* Alarzis ore is very resistant to scratching and to a point pressure, but relatively breakable when subjected to high pressure over time.
* Alarzite is not dense. The largest ones are quite often hollow. Generally speaking, the structure of alarzite is very lightweight.
* Chemical compounds and mineral content of alarzis remain unknown. We can only conjecture the presence of carbon in small quantities.
* Alarzite have distinct cleavage planes. When breaking alarzis, which requires high pressure over a long period of time, it fractures in thick planes that follow the overall form of the crystal.
* Refining alarzis requires an also rare fungus called Mycorise, that can only be grown in dark places, with specific conditions such as temperature and moisture.
* Refining process require alarzis to be purified in alarzite. After that, alarzite must be stored for a long period in a place filled with mycorises so that an unknown chemical coumpound from the fungus can interact with the alarzite.
* The alarzite, after that interaction, must be melt into a whole new metal, the alarzium.

My question is : what could be the properties of alarzium if you have to imagine them ?
